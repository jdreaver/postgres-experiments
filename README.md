# Postgres Experiments

Repo where I mess around with postgres.

## TODO

Have a `create_pgbase_machine` function create common machine bits, and `create_machine` copies the base and then does host-specific modifications.

Create a single "template" rootfs and make machines based on that template (maybe?)
